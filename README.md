## Getting Started

UniToDo makes to do list in unity super simple.

- Place the UniToDo window everywhere you want (UniToDo works best in a vertical window like the Inspector)
- Create a Configuration by clicking on the "Create Configuration" button.
- Set configuration's parameters according to your needs.
- You are now ready to go.
- **Just make sure to hit the Apply Changes button each time you want to save your to do list changes**

*Additional steps*
- Once your first configuration is created you can save it wherever you want and reuse it in your projects using UniTodo.
